Performing Calculations with Vectors 1.1 Exercise Create a vector object called num_vct that contains the following values: 70, 8, 50, 100. Print the contents. Code # Creating the vector. num_vct &lt;- c(70, 8, 50, 100) # Now printing the contents. num_vct ## [1] 70 8 50 100 1.2 Exercise Perform the following tasks with the num_vct object: Multiply the vector by 2. Divide the vector by 10. Subtract 5 from the vector. Add 8 to the vector. Code num_vct * 2 num_vct / 10 num_vct - 5 num_vct + 8 When performing each of the operations above, you will note in the output that the operation is applied to each individual element within the vector. 1.3 Exercise Create a new numeric vector that contains the following values: 5, 7, 9, 10. Name it num_vct2 and print the contents. Code # Creating the vector. num_vct2 &lt;- c(5, 7, 9, 10) #Now printing the contents. num_vct2 ## [1] 5 7 9 10 1.4 Exercise Perform the following tasks with the following two vectors: num_vct and num_vct2. Add num_vct2 to num_vct. Divide num_vct by num_vct2. Multiply num_vct by num_vct2. Subtract num_vct from num_vct2. Code num_vct2 + num_vct num_vct / num_vct2 num_vct * num_vct2 num_vct2 - num_vct When performing each of the operations between the two vectors, you will note in the output that the operation is being applied to the element of each vector in sequential order, according to the index of each element. Let’s take the following operation as an example: num_vct2 - num_vct. The elements of num_vct are: 70, 8, 50, 100 The elements of num_vct2 are: 5, 7, 9, 10 When subtracting num_vct from num_vct2, R performs the following operations according to the ‘position’ of each element in the vector. At index [1], we have 70 for num_vct and 5 for num_vct2 At index [2], we have 8 for num_vct and 7 for num_vct2 At index [3], we have 50 for num_vct and 9 for num_vct2 At index [4], we have 100 for num_vct and 10 for num_vct2 Therefore, R will perform the subtraction operation for each element located at a given index. The output for this operation will be: [1] -65 -1 -41 -90. 1.5 Exercise Create a character vector object that contains the following: I, love, programming, with, R. Name this vector char_vct and print the contents. Code char_vct &lt;- c(&quot;I&quot;, &quot;love&quot;, &quot;programming&quot;, &quot;with&quot;, &quot;R&quot;) char_vct ## [1] &quot;I&quot; &quot;love&quot; &quot;programming&quot; &quot;with&quot; &quot;R&quot; 1.6 Exercise Perform calculations on the character vector. Code char_vct * 2 ## Error in char_vct * 2: non-numeric argument to binary operator What results do you obtain after trying to perform mathematical operations on your character vector? Why ? Let’s say we try to multiply the character vector by 2. Note the error message in the console; none of the tasks can be applied to this vector because these are all arithmetic tasks which work only on numeric vectors. "],["exploring-vectors.html", "2. Exploring Vectors 2.1 Exercise 2.2 Exercise 2.3 Exercise", " 2. Exploring Vectors 2.1 Exercise Use the class() function to find out what type of objects num_vct and char_vct are. Code class(num_vct) class(char_vct) Your R output when applying the class() function to the two vectors should have confirmed that num_vct is a “numeric” vector and that the char_vct is a “character” vector. 2.2 Exercise The number of elements in a vector is referred to as the length of the vector. With small vectors such as those you have already created, you can simply count these. Alternatively, the length() function can be used. Use the length() function to obtain the length of the following objects: num_vct, char_vct, num_vct2. Code length(num_vct) length(char_vct) length(num_vct2) Applying the function for each one of the vectors should have shown you a single number as an output, namely, the number of elements each of the vectors contains. 2.3 Exercise Create a vector object that contains the following logical and numeric values: TRUE, 6, FALSE, 10, FALSE. Name it new_vct and print the contents. Code new_vct &lt;- c(TRUE, 6, FALSE, 10, FALSE) new_vct ## [1] 1 6 0 10 0 Does the output match the contents you entered when you created the vector? Why? The output does not match the contents. Since vectors cannot contain different data types, R will force (i.e. coerce) all entered values to match, in an attempt to lose as little information as possible. In this case, the logical values are coerced to 1 and 0, corresponding to True and False respectively. This is one of the several reasons for why data cleaning is important before proceeding with data analysis; such coercions can have a significant impact on the accuracy of our data and implicitly, on your interpretation of the data. "],["importing-and-exporting-data.html", "3. Importing and Exporting Data 3.1 Exercise 3.2 Exercise 3.3 Exercise 3.4 Exercise 3.5 Exercise 3.6 Exercise 3.7 Exercise 3.8 Exercise", " 3. Importing and Exporting Data Throughout the course units of this programme, you will utilise real datasets to develop your data analysis and interpretation skills. In this exercise, you will practice how to download, access, and import data from the UK Data Service in R. You will use data from the 2019 British Social Attitudes Survey, Poverty and Welfare: Open Access Teaching Dataset. You will also have the opportunity to practice how to export data in various formats. Remember to first register with the UK Data Service. Guidance on how to do this can be found in the Section 1 learning materials on Blackboard. Navigate to the British Social Attitudes Survey (2019) webpage on the UK Data Service website. Scroll down to the end of the webpage and download the dataset in both SPSS and STATA formats on your computer. To access the SPSS data file, unzip folder and open the folders in the following sequence: UKDA-8850-spss &gt; spss &gt; spss25 Follow the same approach for accessing the STATA file. Place these two files in your root R project working directory in a subfolder called data. The recommended approach for a ‘clean’ working directory is to place all the data files you plan to use in a separate folder within your R project working directory. You should always use simple names that allow you easy access to the contents when you want to either explore the folder on your machine or specify the path to these folders in R. 3.1 Exercise Import the dataset in SPSS format; name this object bsas_spss. Code bsas_spss &lt;- read_spss(&quot;data/bsa2019_poverty_open.sav&quot;) ## Error in read_spss(&quot;data/bsa2019_poverty_open.sav&quot;): could not find function &quot;read_spss&quot; Did the import function work? Why? If you have not loaded the haven package, you will be prompted with the following error in the R console. To load the package, type library(haven) in your console first and after that, the code for importing the data. Remember to always start your work in R by first loading all the packages that you require for your session. 3.2 Exercise Import the dataset in STATA format; name this object bsas_stata. Code bsas_stata &lt;- read_dta(&quot;data/bsa2019_poverty_open.dta&quot;) How many observations and variables do the bsas_spss and bsas_stata objects have? Are these identical for both objects? There are many different ways to find the number of observations and variables such as looking at the information in the Environment tab. Since both data files are identical, both objects contain an identical number of observations and variables. 3.3 Exercise Export both bsas_spss and bsas_stata data objects in .RData format. Code save(bsas_spss, bsas_stata, file = &quot;data/bsas_objects.RData&quot;) Remember to keep your root working directory organised and save/export your data files in your data folder. 3.4 Exercise Now export bsas_spss as a single object in .RDS format. Code saveRDS(bsas_spss, &quot;data/bsas_spss_file.RDS&quot;) 3.5 Exercise Finally, export the bsas_stata object as a .csv file. Code write.csv(bsas_stata, &quot;data/bsas_stata_file.csv&quot;) 3.6 Exercise Import the .csv file you have created and name this object bsas_stata2. View the contents of the bsas_stata2 and bsas_stata objects. What are the differences between the two, if any? Why? Code bsas_stata2 &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/bsas_stata_file.csv&quot;) Are there any differences between bsas_stata2 and bsas_stata? If there are, Why? Thebsas_stata objected imported with the haven package has accompanying metadata. When exporting data files with metadata as .csv files, this metadata is lost because this type of format does not support metadata in the same way that files such as SPSS and STATA do. Also, you may note that the bsas_stata2 has 27 rather than 26 variables; by default, the write.csv() function will automatically number each row in the data file and therefore, will produce an additional column. 3.7 Exercise Now import the .RDS created and name this object bsas_spss2. Code bsas_spss2 &lt;- readRDS(&quot;data/bsas_spss_file.RDS&quot;) 3.8 Exercise Finally, load the .Rdata file you created. Code load(&quot;data/bsas_objects.RData&quot;) You will use some of these data objects in future practicals. Please make sure that you keep all of the data files from this section in your data folder. "],["bonus-task-data-on-github.html", "4. Bonus Task: Data on GitHub 4.1 Exercise 4.2 Exercise 4.3 Exercise 4.4 Exercise", " 4. Bonus Task: Data on GitHub Importing Data from Github Repositories Many different types of data can be imported in R using either base R functions or functions from packages. However, R is not limited to importing ‘hard copy’ files from your machine but also supports direct import of data files located on websites for example. GitHub is a cloud-based, online platform that allows programming users to openly share research projects, associated documentation, data files, and comments with other users and/or the public. You will learn more about GitHub later in the course. Explore the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering COVID-19 Github Repository. Open the csse_covid_19_data folder found at the beginning of the page. Then open the csse_covid_19_time_series folder. Click on time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv link. Click on the Raw button on the right hand side of the screen. The webpage will now show you a long series of numbers. This is the ‘data file’ that you need to import. Note that this file is a .csv file. The same base R function you have previously used will also work in this case. 4.1 Exercise To import the data file, create a new object called covid_johnshop. Within the base R .csv function, paste the full data file web link. Do not forget to enclose this link with quotation marks. Code covid_johnshop &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv&quot;) 4.2 Exercise View the contents of this object.

In this section, you will be introduced to the following functions:: Function Description Package factor() create factors base R data.frame() create data frames base R list() create lists base R matrix() create matrices base R dim() find dimensions of object (e.g. number of variables and observations) base R attributes() find attributes/characteristics of object base R str() view internal structure of object base R table() build contingency table base R head() view first parts of data object base R tail() view last parts of data object base R colnames() find or set row or column names of a matrix-like object base R names() find or set row or column names of a data object base R summary() obtain summary statistics base R sum() obtain of sum of values base R is.na() identifies NA values; returns a logical output (TRUE/FALSE) for each element in an object base R WARNING 1: Before proceeding to the exercises, ensure that you work in a RStudio project and that you write and save your answers to the exercises in an R script. WARNING 2: To adequately develop your practical programming skills, it is essential that you attempt all exercises by typing out the code rather than simply copy-pasting the answers. "],["practical-1.html", "Practical 1 1.1 Vectors and Factors 1.2 Data Frames and Lists 1.3 Matrices and Arrays 1.4 Bonus Task", " Practical 1 1.1 Vectors and Factors 1.1.1 Exercise Create and print a vector object named data_vct that contains the following values: 8, incorrect, 9.8. Code data_vct &lt;- c(8, &quot;incorrect&quot;, 9.8) data_vct ## [1] &quot;8&quot; &quot;incorrect&quot; &quot;9.8&quot; What output does R produce? Why? Vectors can only contain a single data type since they are homogenous structures and in this exercise, there are two data types in this vector, namely numeric and character. When R detects multiple data types within a vector, it will, by default, coerce all values to a single data type. Since the character value cannot be coerced to a numeric value, R will coerce all values to character. This is irrespective of whether the values are logical or numeric. Alternatively, if you did not place the word “incorrect” between inverted commas such as data_vct &lt;- c(8, incorrect, 9.8), then the attempt to create the vector would have failed and you would have been prompted by an error message: Error: object 'incorrect' not found. The reason for this is that only logical values can be specified as text in vectors without inverted commas; anything else will be a character value and must be specified within inverted commas. 1.1.2 Exercise Create a vector object named data_vct2 that contains the following values: 8, FALSE, 9.8. Code data_vct2 &lt;- c(8, FALSE, 9.8) class(data_vct2) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; What output does R produce? What class is this vector? Why? This is another example of how R coerces values to have a consistent data type when detecting heterogeneity in a vector. In this case, the word FALSE must be specified as a logical value. This value is coerced to numeric because, by default, logical values in R are converted to 0 and 1, corresponding to FALSE and TRUE respectively. Alternatively, if you have specified the word FALSE as a character value, then the logical value would have been coerced to a character value and the vector would have been a vector of class character. 1.1.3 Exercise Create a vector object named data_vct3 that contains the following values: 8, False, 9.8, True. Code data_vct3 &lt;- c(8, False, 9.8, True) ## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object &#39;False&#39; not found What output does R produce? Why? If your treated this value as a logical value, then you would have obtained an error since logical values are case sensitive and can only take two different forms: TRUE or T, FALSE or F. 1.1.4 Exercise Create a factor named data_fct that contains the following values: bus, car, car, car, train, bus, bus, train, train. Print the contents, find the number of levels, and confirm the class. Code data_fct &lt;- factor(c(&quot;bus&quot;, &quot;car&quot;, &quot;car&quot;, &quot;car&quot;, &quot;train&quot;, &quot;bus&quot;, &quot;bus&quot;, &quot;train&quot;, &quot;train&quot;)) data_fct class(data_fct) This object is of class factor and has three levels bus, car, train. The output should look like below: data_fct [1] bus car car car train bus bus train train Levels: bus car train class(data_fct) [1] \"factor\" 1.1.5 Exercise Create three vectors as follows: A numeric vector called num_vct which contains the following values: 50, 10, 45, 90. A character vector called char_vct which contains the following values: This, is, a, string, vector. A logical vector called logic_vct which contains the following values: TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE. Code num_vct &lt;- c(50, 10, 45, 90) char_vct &lt;- c(&quot;This&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;string&quot;, &quot;vector&quot;) logic_vct &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE) 1.2 Data Frames and Lists 1.2.1 Exercise Create a data frame called df by combing the following three vectors you previously created (num_vct, char_vct, logic_vct). Code df &lt;- data.frame(num_vct, char_vct, logic_vct) ## Error in data.frame(num_vct, char_vct, logic_vct): arguments imply differing number of rows: 4, 5 What does the R output say? Why? As you probably already noticed when finding the lengths of each vector earlier in the practical, the numeric vector has 4 rows whilst the character and logical vectors have 5 rows. When creating data frames, all vectors must have the same length, otherwise, you will be prompted by an error: Error in data.frame(num_vct, char_vct, logic_vct) : arguments imply differing number of rows: 4, 5. 1.2.2 Exercise Since a data frame cannot be created with vectors of different lengths, try to instead create a list object called list_one and print the contents. Code # Creating the list list_one &lt;- list(num_vct, char_vct, logic_vct) # Printing the list. list_one ## [[1]] ## [1] 50 10 45 90 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] &quot;This&quot; &quot;is&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;string&quot; &quot;vector&quot; ## ## [[3]] ## [1] TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE Did you successfully create a list? Why did this work (or didn’t)? The list was created successfully since lists are both heterogenous structures and can take different types of items regardless of their structure. No error message should appear. Can you find out how many variables and observations this list has? How about the number of items? List structures do not have variables or observations since they are a storage mode of different types of items. Instead, lists are defined by the number of items they contain. If you print the contents, you can confirm that this list has 3 items. 1.2.3 Exercise Use the View() function to visualise the contents of the list. Code View(list_one) Is the output similar to that from a data frame object? Why not? The View() function produces a different output for lists than in does for data frames since these are different structures. Data frames have rows and columns whilst lists have items. The view function is not very useful for lists because it is designed for users to visualise data values, but it does provide some relevant information such as the number of items, the data type of each item, and a compact summary of the values of each item. 1.2.4 Exercise Create a new vector called num_vct3 with the following values: 50, 10, 45, 90, 5. Code num_vct3 &lt;- c(50, 10, 45, 90, 5) 1.2.5 Exercise Create a data frame called df_one by combing num_vct3 with the following logical and character vectors you created earlier (char_vct, logic_vct). Then print the contents. Code df_one &lt;- data.frame(num_vct3, char_vct, logic_vct) df_one ## num_vct3 char_vct logic_vct ## 1 50 This TRUE ## 2 10 is FALSE ## 3 45 a FALSE ## 4 90 string TRUE ## 5 5 vector TRUE How many variables and observations does this data frame have? There are 5 observations of 3 variables. This is easy to identify with small data objects such as this one. For larger datasets, you can easily spot this by looking under the Environment tab. 1.2.6 Exercise Create a list called list_two by combining three of the vectors you created earlier (num_vct3, num_vct, char_vct, logic_vct). Code list_two &lt;- list(num_vct3, num_vct, char_vct, logic_vct) 1.3 Matrices and Arrays 1.3.1 Exercise Create and print a matrix named matrix_one that contains the following values: 1, 4, 6, 10. The values must be placed in two rows and two columns. Code matrix_one &lt;- matrix(c(1,4,6,10), nrow = 2, ncol = 2) matrix_one ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 6 ## [2,] 4 10 1.3.2 Exercise Create and print a matrix named matrix_two that contains the following sequence of values: 10 to 13. The values must be placed in one row row and four columns. Code matrix_two &lt;- matrix(10:13, nrow = 1, ncol = 4) matrix_two ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 10 11 12 13 1.3.3 Exercise Create a matrix named matrix_three using the following numeric vector you created earlier (num_vct). The values must be placed in four rows and one column. Print the contents. Code matrix_three &lt;- matrix(num_vct, nrow = 4, ncol = 1) matrix_three ## [,1] ## [1,] 50 ## [2,] 10 ## [3,] 45 ## [4,] 90 1.4 Bonus Task Create a list using the list of items below and name it list_example. Print the contents num_vct matrix_three df_one list_two \"character string\" 1000 Code list_example &lt;- list(num_vct, matrix_three, df_one, list_two, &quot;character string&quot;, 1000) list_example ## [[1]] ## [1] 50 10 45 90 ## ## [[2]] ## [,1] ## [1,] 50 ## [2,] 10 ## [3,] 45 ## [4,] 90 ## ## [[3]] ## num_vct3 char_vct logic_vct ## 1 50 This TRUE ## 2 10 is FALSE ## 3 45 a FALSE ## 4 90 string TRUE ## 5 5 vector TRUE ## ## [[4]] ## [[4]][[1]] ## [1] 50 10 45 90 5 ## ## [[4]][[2]] ## [1] 50 10 45 90 ## ## [[4]][[3]] ## [1] &quot;This&quot; &quot;is&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;string&quot; &quot;vector&quot; ## ## [[4]][[4]] ## [1] TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE ## ## ## [[5]] ## [1] &quot;character string&quot; ## ## [[6]] ## [1] 1000 Is it possible for a list to contain any type of data structure and if so why? Can you find out how many items the list has? Lists are highly flexible data structures and can contain any data type or object items, regardless of whether they are single values, or more complex structures. Lists also support nesting, which means that they can also contain other lists. There are 6 items in this list: a vector, a matrix, a data frame, a list, a character value, and a numeric value. This list is quite a large one and printing the contents is not a very useful way to view the items. You will learn alternatives functions to display data structures more compactly later in the course. "],["practical-2.html", "Practical 2 2.1 Exploring Homogenous Data Structures 2.2 Exploring Heterogenous Data Structures", " Practical 2 2.1 Exploring Homogenous Data Structures 2.1.1 Exercise Create the following vectors: A numeric vector called numeric_vct comprising of: 8, 10, 5, 9, 6, 0, 2, 3. A character vector called char_vct comprising of: bus, train, train, car, car, bus, train, bus. A factor called commuting comprising of the same values as those of char_vct. A factor called commuting2 comprising of the same values as those of commuting. Use the levels argument to specify the following levels to the factor: bus, car, train, taxi. A numeric vector called num_vct comprising of: 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 4. Transform this numeric vector into a factor called education and assign it the following labels: GCSE, Alevel, undergraduate, graduate. Code numeric_vector &lt;- c(8, 10, 5, 9, 6, 0, 2, 3) char_vct &lt;- c(&quot;bus&quot;, &quot;train&quot;, &quot;train&quot;, &quot;car&quot;, &quot;car&quot;, &quot;bus&quot;, &quot;train&quot;, &quot;bus&quot;) commuting &lt;- factor(char_vct) commuting2 &lt;- factor(char_vct, levels = c(&quot;bus&quot;, &quot;car&quot;, &quot;train&quot;, &quot;taxi&quot;)) num_vct &lt;- c(1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 4) education &lt;- factor(num_vct, labels = c(&quot;GCSE&quot;, &quot;Alevel&quot;, &quot;undergraduate&quot;, &quot;graduate&quot;)) Explore commuting and commuting2 using the table() function. How do the levels and number of observations of these two vectors differ? Code table(commuting) table(commuting2) The object values are of course identical for levels bus, car, and train but you have also added one more level to commuting2, namely taxi. As you would have seen in the output in your RStudio console, there are zero observations for this factor level. &gt; table(commuting2) bus car train taxi 3 2 3 0 Versus &gt; table(commuting) bus car train 3 2 3 This illustrates that levels can be added to factors even though observations for that particular level are not present in the ‘dataset’. This is an important feature of factors during statistical analysis since the absence of data is meaningful for categorical variables. 2.1.2 Exercise Create a matrix object called matrix_object using one of the numeric vectors you created earlier (numeric_vector).

Code list_combined &lt;- list(numeric_vector, commuting, education, data_frame) Exercise 2.2.5 Use the appropriate function to view the contents of list_combined in a compact form. Code str(list_combined) ## List of 4 ## $ : num [1:8] 8 10 5 9 6 0 2 3 ## $ : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;bus&quot;,&quot;car&quot;,&quot;train&quot;: 1 3 3 2 2 1 3 1 ## $ : Factor w/ 4 levels &quot;GCSE&quot;,&quot;Alevel&quot;,..: 1 2 1 3 2 3 3 1 1 2 ... ## $ :&#39;data.frame&#39;: 8 obs. of 3 variables: ## ..$ numeric_vector: num [1:8] 8 10 5 9 6 0 2 3 ## ..$ char_vct : chr [1:8] &quot;bus&quot; &quot;train&quot; &quot;train&quot; &quot;car&quot; ... ## ..$ commuting : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;bus&quot;,&quot;car&quot;,&quot;train&quot;: 1 3 3 2 2 1 3 1 What does the output tell you about list_combined? The str() function provides the total number of items in an object (in this case a list), the class of each item, as well as the number of elements within each item. There are 4 items; in the order in which they would appear in your console, these are: a numeric vector of 8 elements, a factor with 3 levels, a factor with 4 levels, and a data frame composed of a numeric, character, and factor. "],["practical-3.html", "Practical 3 3.1 Exploring Data Files 3.2 Subsetting 3.3 Basic Transformations", " Practical 3 3.1 Exploring Data Files In Section 1, you have completed a series of file import/export exercises using data from British Social Attitudes Survey (2019): Open Access Teaching Dataset. For this practical, you will use one of the objects you have exported as a .csv file in your R project data folder, namely the bsas_stata object. 3.1.1 Exercise Import the bsas_stata .csv object and name this object bsas_dataset. Code bsas_dataset &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/bsas_stata_file.csv&quot;) Explore the structure of the data object and confirm its class. How many observations and variables does this object have? Use the class() function to confirm that the data object is a data.frame. You can explore the structure of the object in various ways such as using the str() function which also tells you the number of observations and variables. You can also, of course, obtain this information from your Environment pane. 3.1.2 Exercise Use the appropriate function to obtain a compact summary statistics output.

Why? No; variables in survey datasets are often coded in numeric form, regardless of whether these are actually numeric or categorical. Datasets from reputable sources such as the UK Data Service (UKDS), are accompanied by data dictionaries which describe and explain in detail what each variable measures and how it is coded in the data file. For data that you download from the UKDS, the data dictionary can be found in the mrdoc folder. In general, datasets from the UKDS will be available in a format that hosts metadata (e.g. Stata, SPSS). This means that if you explore the variables in a SPSS or Stata data file you imported in R, you will note that variables are accompanied by metadata. Those which are categorical are also accompanied by labels which describe the categories to which numeric values belong. However, since you are now using the file you exported as a .csv, you will remember that such files do not host any metadata. 3.1.3 Exercise To practice using data dictionaries, open the mrdoc subfolder within the main folder you downloaded (starts with UKDA-8850…). Extract the file from the zippeed ukda_data_dictionaries folder. Find the following variables in the data dictionary: NatFrEst, RSex, Married, and RAgeCat. What do these variables measure and how are they coded? According to the data dictionary: NatFrEst asks survey respondents to provide an estimated numeric value for the following question: Out of every 100 people receiving benefits in Britain, how many have broken the law by giving false information to support their claim?. RSex represents the sex of the respondent. Males are numerically labelled as “1” and females as “2”. Married represents the marital status of the respondent. There are four categories labelled “1” to “4”. RAgeCat represents the age category into which the respondent falls. Age is grouped into 7 categories labelled “1” to “7”. 3.2 Subsetting 3.2.1 Exercise Create a new data frame object called bsas_sample that contains the following variables in this order: NatFrEst, RSex, Married, and RAgeCat. Code bsas_sample &lt;- bsas_dataset[c(&quot;NatFrEst&quot;, &quot;RSex&quot;, &quot;Married&quot;, &quot;RAgeCat&quot;)] As you have already seen in the lecture materials, there are various ways to achieve this. One simple way is to specify a character vector of variable names using c() within square brackets used to subset a data object. 3.2.2 Exercise Find the class of variable Married. Code class(bsas_sample$Married) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; Would you be able to analyse this variable as it is, without any further transformation? In most cases, the answer would be NO, since this variable is categorical and should be coded as a factor. If you also explore RSex and RAgeCat, you would also see that they are also of class integer. To ensure that you recode all relevant variables correctly, you must consult the data dictionaries. 3.3 Basic Transformations 3.3.1 Exercise Use colnames() function to change the names of the variables as follows: NatFrEst to false_benefits RSex to sex Married to marital_status RAgeCat to age_cat Code colnames(bsas_sample) &lt;- c(&quot;false_benefits&quot;, &quot;sex&quot;, &quot;marital_status&quot;, &quot;age_category&quot;) Now confirm that the column names have been changed. Code colnames(bsas_sample) ## [1] &quot;false_benefits&quot; &quot;sex&quot; &quot;marital_status&quot; &quot;age_category&quot; Code # You can use the same function or, more simply: # names(bsas_sample) 3.3.2 Exercise Using the table() function, explore the contents of the variable false_benefits. Code table(bsas_sample$false_benefits) ## ## 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 13 15 18 19 20 23 25 27 ## 8 68 82 43 25 192 3 14 10 1 354 7 1 90 1 1 286 1 190 3 ## 30 32 33 35 38 40 42 43 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 55 56 57 59 60 ## 194 2 19 45 1 188 1 3 23 2 1 2 1 436 2 20 1 2 1 160 ## 63 65 66 68 69 70 75 78 79 80 82 85 86 88 90 93 95 98 99 100 ## 1 29 2 2 2 107 77 2 1 126 2 18 1 2 58 1 10 4 19 30 ## 998 999 ## 242 4 Are there any strange values and if so, what do they mean? Based on the data dictionary you have consulted in the previous exercise, you should already know that each one of the four variables, regardless of whether it is measured on a numeric or nominal scale, has labels that denote missing data. For the variable false_benefits, there are several missing data since both 998 and 999 labels appear in the table. This type of information is very important for recoding/tranforming variables correctly. 3.3.3 Exercise Perform the following modifications to the variables below: For marital_status, change the 9 values to NA. For age_category , change the 8 values to NA. For false_benefits, change the 998 and 999 values to NA. Code bsas_sample$marital_status[bsas_sample$marital_status == 9] &lt;- NA bsas_sample$age_category[bsas_sample$age_category == 8] &lt;- NA bsas_sample$false_benefits[bsas_sample$false_benefits &gt; 900] &lt;- NA For the false_benefits variable, the simplest approach is to specify a value large enough to encompass both 998 and 999. In this case, the maximum value is 100 after which there are no values corresponding to any number between 100 and 998. How many NA values does the variable false_benefits have in total? Code sum(is.na(bsas_sample$false_benefits)) ## [1] 246 3.3.4 Exercise For the sex variable, change the 1 values to Male and the 2 values to Female. Code bsas_sample$sex[bsas_sample$sex == 1] &lt;- &quot;Male&quot; bsas_sample$sex[bsas_sample$sex == 2 ] &lt;- &quot;Female&quot; For the purposes of this practical, it is acceptable to perform factor recoding for each category individually. You will learn how to do this more efficiently later in in the course. Now confirm the changes using a suitable function. Code table(bsas_sample$sex) ## ## Female Male ## 1770 1454 What is the class of the variable now? Code class(bsas_sample$sex) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; After changing the numeric labels to character labels, the variable is now of class character. To make this variable a factor, we need an extra step: bsas_sample$sex &lt;- factor(bsas_sample$sex). 3.3.5 Exercise Create a new vector object called id that contains a sequence of values from 1 to 3,224. Code id &lt;- 1:3224 Add the id vector as a column to the bsas_sample data frame. Code bsas_sample$id &lt;- id Where in the data frame was this new ‘vector’ added? Code str(bsas_sample) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 3224 obs. of 5 variables: ## $ false_benefits: int 5 30 50 50 50 10 1 NA 5 50 ... ## $ sex : chr &quot;Female&quot; &quot;Female&quot; &quot;Female&quot; &quot;Male&quot; ... ## $ marital_status: int 1 2 1 4 4 1 4 1 1 4 ... ## $ age_category : int 6 3 4 2 6 4 2 4 4 1 ... ## $ id : int 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... You can find this out in various ways, one being str(). The new column was added at the end of the data frame. The purpose of adding an ID column is to uniquely identify each case within the data frame (in cases where no such ID exists). You will learn more about why this is important, later in the course. 3.3.6 Exercise Reorder the variables of bsas_sample as follows: id, RSex, RAgeCat, Married, and NatFrEst. Code bsas_sample &lt;- bsas_sample[, c(&quot;id&quot;, &quot;sex&quot;, &quot;age_category&quot;, &quot;marital_status&quot;, &quot;false_benefits&quot;)] Confirm the change in order using a suitable function. Code # You can use the names() function, for example. names(bsas_sample) ## [1] &quot;id&quot; &quot;sex&quot; &quot;age_category&quot; &quot;marital_status&quot; ## [5] &quot;false_benefits&quot; "],["overview-2.html", "Overview", " Overview Section 3: Manipulating and Tidying Data Learning Outcomes: ADD ILOS.
