Code num_vct &lt;- c(70, 8, 50, 100) Print the contents. Code num_vct ## [1] 70 8 50 100 Use the class() function to find out what type of object num_vct is. Code class(num_vct) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; Multiply this vector by 2. Code num_vct * 2 ## [1] 140 16 100 200 Divide the vector by 10. Code num_vct / 10 ## [1] 7.0 0.8 5.0 10.0 Subtract 5 from the vector. Code num_vct - 5 ## [1] 65 3 45 95 Add 8 to the vector. Code num_vct + 8 ## [1] 78 16 58 108 1.1.2 Exercise Create a character vector object that contains the following: I, love, programming, with, R. Name this vector char_vct and print the contents. Use the class() function to find out what type of object char_vct is. Perform tasks b to e from Exercise 1. What results do you obtain? Why? 1.1.3 Exercise Create a new numeric vector that contains the following values: 5, 7, 9, 10. Name it num_vct2 and print the contents. Add num_vct2 to num_vct. Divide num_vct by num_vct2. Multiply num_vct2 by num_vct. Subtract num_vct from num_vct2 1.1.4 Exercise The number of elements in a vector is referred to as the length of the vector. With small vectors such as those you have already created, you can simply count these. Alternatively, the length() function can be used. Use the length function to obtain the length of the following objects: num_vct, char_vct, num_vct2. 1.1.5 Exercise Create a vector object that contains the following logical and numeric values: TRUE, 6, FALSE, 10, FALSE. Name it new_vct and print the output. Does the output match the contents you entered when you created the vector? Why? 1.2 Importing and Exporting Data Throughout the course units of this programme, you will utilise real datasets to develop your data analysis and interpretation skills. For this exercise, you will navigate to the UK Data Service (UKDS) website and acquire the British Social Attitudes Survey (2019), Poverty and Welfare: Open Access Teaching Dataset. 1.2.1 Exercise Navigate to the British Social Attitudes Survey (2019) webpage on the UK Data Service website (https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=8850#!/access-data) Scroll down to the end of the webpage and download the dataset in both SPSS and STATA formats in your R project working directory. To access the SPSS data file, unzip folder and open the folders in the following sequence: UKDA-8850-spss &gt; spss &gt; spss25. Follow the same approach for accessing the STATA file. Place these two files in your root R project working directory or within a sub-folder in this directory. Import the dataset in SPSS format; name this object bsas_spss. Import the dataset in STATA format; name this object bsas_stata. 1.2.2 Exercise How many observations and variables do the bsas_spss and bsas_stata objects have? Are these identical for both objects? Use the view function to explore these data objects. 1.2.3 Exercise Export both bsas_spss and bsas_stata data objects in .RData format. 1.2.4 Exercise Export bsas_spss as a single object in .RDS format. 1.2.5 Exercise Export the bsas_stata object as a .csv file. 1.2.6 Exercise Import the .csv file you have just created and name this object bsas_stata2. View the contents of the bsas_stata2 and bsas_stata objects. What are the differences between the two, if any? Why? Import the spss you have created and name this object bsas_spss2. Load the .Rdata file your created. 1.3 Bonus Task: Data on GitHub Importing Data from Github Repositories Many different types of data can be imported in R using either base R functions or functions from packages. However, R is not limited to importing ‘hard copy’ files from your machine but also supports direct import of data files located on websites for example. A Github Repository is a cloud-based, online platform that allows programming users to openly share research projects, associated documentation, data files, and comments with other users and/or the public. Explore the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering COVID-19 Github Repository (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) Open the csse_covid_19_data folder found at the beginning of the page. Then open the csse_covid_19_time_series folder. Click on time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv link. Click on View Raw. The webpage will now show you a long series of numbers. This is the ‘data file’ that you need to import. Note that this file is a .csv file. The same base R function you have previously used will also work in this case. To import the data file, create a new object called covid_johnshop. Within the base R .csv function, paste the full data file web link. Do not forget to enclose this link with quotation marks. View the contents of this object. How many observations and variables does this object have? What class is this object?

Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.
