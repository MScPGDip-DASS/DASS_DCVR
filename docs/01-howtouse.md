::: attention
**1:** Before beginning the practical exercises, it is recommended that you create a RStudio project for this course and work through the exercises in each section using this project. 

**2:** You should **write** and **save** your answers to the exercises in R script. You should have at least one R script for each course unit section. 

**3:** To adequately develop your practical programming skills, it is absolutely **essential** that you attempt all exercises by typing out the code rather than simply copy-pasting the answers.
